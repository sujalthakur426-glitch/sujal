### 3. Short Write-up (Methodology, Insights, Strategies)


#### **Methodology**
1. **Data Integration:** Unified daily sentiment data with granular Hyperliquid transaction logs by synchronizing Unix timestamps (seconds vs. milliseconds) and normalizing to UTC dates.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Developed metrics for "Win Rate," "Long Bias," and "Position Aggression" (Size USD).
3. **Comparative Analysis:** Grouped data into three regimes (Fear, Greed, Neutral) to identify statistical shifts in performance.

#### **Key Insights**
* **Neutrality is the Risk Zone:** Neutral sentiment (Index 45-55) yielded the lowest win rate (31.7%) and highest average drawdown. Markets without a clear emotional trend are the most difficult for traders to navigate.
* **The "Fear" Dip-Buying Bias:** Traders on Hyperliquid significantly increase their position sizes during **Fear** (Avg: \$5,260) compared to **Greed** (Avg: \$3,581). This suggests the platform is a primary venue for "bottom fishers."
* **Greed Efficiency:** While Fear drives the most volume, **Greed** days are the most efficient for profit, offering a 4% higher win rate than Fear days.

#### **Strategy Recommendations**
* **Rule 1 (The Neutral Filter):** During Neutral sentiment days, traders should reduce position sizes by 50% or avoid trading high-leverage perps to prevent "chop" losses.
* **Rule 2 (Size Up into Fear):** Leverage the discovered "Dip-Buying" edge by increasing trade conviction only when the Fear/Greed Index drops below 30, mimicking the behavior of the "Consistent Winner" segment.
* **Rule 3 (The Greed Exit):** As win rates peak in Greed, traders should implement trailing stops rather than opening new positions, as the data shows "Extreme Greed" often leads to diminishing marginal returns.
